The 0x01-variables_if_else_while project is a coding project offered by the ALX program, designed to introduce learners to the fundamentals of programming in the C language. This project focuses on three key concepts: variables, if/else statements, and loops.

The project is divided into three parts, each of which introduces and expands upon one of these concepts. In the first part, learners are introduced to the concept of variables and are tasked with creating a program that assigns values to variables and performs simple arithmetic operations on them.

In the second part of the project, learners are introduced to if/else statements, which allow programs to make decisions based on certain conditions. Learners are tasked with creating a program that uses if/else statements to determine whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

Finally, in the third part of the project, learners are introduced to loops, which allow programs to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. Learners are tasked with creating a program that prints all the numbers between 0 and 99 using a loop.

Overall, the 0x01-variables_if_else_while project is a valuable introduction to the basics of programming in C, and provides learners with the foundational knowledge they need to build more complex programs in the future.
