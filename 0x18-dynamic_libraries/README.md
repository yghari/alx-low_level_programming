Project 0x18-dynamic_libraries is a software engineering project that focuses on the creation and use of dynamic libraries in C programming language. The project requires the creation of two dynamic libraries which will be used by a program to perform certain operations.

The project consists of several tasks, including:

Creating two dynamic libraries: The project requires the creation of two dynamic libraries, libholberton.so and libprintf.so. These libraries will contain functions that will be used by the main program to perform specific operations.

Compiling the dynamic libraries: Once the dynamic libraries are created, they need to be compiled and linked to the main program. This involves using the gcc compiler and the -shared flag to create the dynamic library.

Using the dynamic libraries: The main program will use the functions from the dynamic libraries to perform certain operations. These functions will be loaded into memory at runtime, instead of being linked at compile time.

Understanding the differences between static and dynamic libraries: The project requires an understanding of the differences between static and dynamic libraries, and when each should be used.

Documenting the project: The project should be thoroughly documented, including the purpose of the dynamic libraries and how they are used by the main program.

Overall, project 0x18-dynamic_libraries provides a practical introduction to the creation and use of dynamic libraries in C programming language. It requires an understanding of important concepts such as dynamic linking, function loading at runtime, and the differences between static and dynamic libraries.
